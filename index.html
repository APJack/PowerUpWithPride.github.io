    <h1>What is PUWP?</h1>
    <p>Power Up With Pride: benefitting LGBTQIA+ speedrunners, featuring LGBTQIA+ speedrunners.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2016, Power Up With Pride is a video gaming charity marathon for charity, created by the LGBTQIA+ speedrunning community for the community at large.</p>
    <p>During our summer and winter events, we showcase speedruns, challenge runs, community games, with an emphasis on LGBTQIA+ and ally speedrunners, while coming together as a community to raise money for LGBTQIA+ charities.</p>
